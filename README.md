# Mask Detection and Penalty System

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing masks 
in public places or congested areas is the most important form of
safety for people. This paper presents a two-class classification model 
for detecting face masks, such as "mask detected" and "no mask 
detected." We achieved an accuracy of 98.89% using deep learning 
and 97.5% using machine learning. If a person is not wearing a mask, 
then that person has to pay the fine using the "Payment ID" received 
via text message and these messages are sent with the help of face-recognition. The model will work with static images as well as a live 
video stream. It is also possible to provide mass screening, and it can 
be used in congested or crowded areas such as stores, malls, and 
colleges, and others.
